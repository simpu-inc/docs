Welcome to the Simpu API documentation. This guide is designed to help developers integrate Simpu's powerful customer communication platform into their applications, enabling seamless management of customer interactions across multiple channels.

The Simpu API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, also returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
